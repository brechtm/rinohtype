RinohType
=========

RinohType is a document processor in the style of LaTeX_. It can render
structured text documents to PDF based on a document template and a style sheet.
An important goal of RinohType is to be more user-friendly than LaTeX. This
includes providing clear error messages and making it very easy to adjust the
document style.

RinohType is currently in a near-beta phase and thus unsuited for production
use, but you can use it to explore RinohType's features and bugs. I'd highly
appreciate if you could `create a ticket`_ for any bugs you encounter. You can
find some articles on my `blog`_ discussing RinohType's development progress.

Currently, RinohType only supports reStructuredText_ input. It ships with the
``rinoh`` command line tool to render basic reStructuredText documents and
a Sphinx_ builder to render more complex documents. The included document
templates and style sheets are fairly basic but these will be improved in the
future.

Please, be warned that some older versions of PDF readers have trouble displaying the PDFs
generated by RinohType (`issue 2`_):

- Firefox's built-in PDF viewer (pdf.js) - *fixed somewhere around Firefox 37.0 (March 2015)*
- Evince and other poppler_-based applications (e.g. Zathura) - *fixed in Poppler version 0.41 (February 2016)*

Requirements
------------

RinohType currently only runs on Python 3.2 and up. It might be back-ported to
Python 2.7 at some point in the future, but this is not certain.

For parsing reStructuredText documents RinohType depends on docutils_. For
parsing PNG images we require pure-Python PurePNG_. pip_ takes care of these
requirement when you install RinohType. If you want to include images other
than PDF, PNG or JPEG, you will need Pillow_.

Getting Started
---------------

Command-line reStructuredText renderer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get started with RinohType is to render a reStructuredText
document (such as `demo.txt`_) using the ``rinoh`` command line tool::

   rinoh demo.txt

When the script finishes, you will find ``demo.pdf`` alongside the input file.

``rinoh`` renders the input document using the article template. You can specify
the paper size using the ``--paper`` command line argument.

Sphinx Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use RinohType to render Sphinx documents, you need to adjust the Sphinx
project's ``conf.py``:

1. add ``rinoh.frontend.sphinx`` to the ``extensions`` list, and
2. set the ``rinoh_documents`` configuration option::

    rinoh_documents = [('index',          # top-level rst file (index.rst)
                        'target',         # output (sphinx.pdf)
                        'Document Title,  # document title
                        'Author')]        # document author

3. now we can select the `rinoh` builder when building the documentation::

    sphinx-build -b rinoh . _build/rinoh


License
-------

All of RinohType's source code is licensed under the `Affero GPL`_, unless
indicated otherwise in the source file (such as ``hyphenator.py``).

My intention is to make RinohType free for non-commercial use and offer a
separate license for commercial use. The AGPL will likely be replaced soon with
another license to better reflect this intention.

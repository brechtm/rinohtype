Rinohtype is a document processor in the style of LaTeX_. It renders structured
documents to PDF based on a document template and a style sheet. An important
goal of rinohtype is to be more user-friendly than LaTeX. This includes
providing clear error messages and making it very easy to adjust the document
style. See the documentation_ to learn how to customize the style of your
document.

Rinohtype is currently in a beta phase and thus not recommended for production
use, but you can use it to explore rinohtype's features and bugs. I'd highly
appreciate it if you could `create a ticket`_ for any bugs you may encounter.
However, rinohtype is already very capable. Here is a list of its main
features:

* a powerful page layout system supporting columns, running headers/footers,
  floatable elements and footnotes
* support for figures, and (large) tables
* automatically generated table of contents and index
* automatic numbering and cross-referencing of section headings, figures and
  tables
* use one of the included document templates or create your own
* an intuitive style sheet system inspired by CSS
* modular design allowing for multiple frontends (such as reStructuredText,
  Markdown, DocBook, ...)
* handles OpenType, TrueType and Type1 fonts with support for advanced
  typographic features such as kerning, ligatures and small capitals
* embeds PDF, PNG and JPEG images, preserving transparency and color profiles
* easy to deploy; pure-Python with few dependencies
* built on Unicode; ready for non-latin languages

Rinohtype's primary input format is reStructuredText_. The ``rinoh`` command
line tool renders reStructuredText documents and the included Sphinx_ builder
obsoletes the need for a large LaTeX installation to produce PDF output. Have
a look at the `rinohtype documentation`_ for an example of the output.

Please, be warned that some older versions of PDF readers have trouble
displaying the PDFs generated by rinohtype (`issue 2`_):

- pre-37.0 Firefox's built-in PDF viewer (pdf.js)
- pre-0.41 poppler_-based applications such as Evince

Requirements
------------

Rinohtype supports Python 3.3+. It *might* be back-ported to Python 2.7 at some
point in the future if there are a lot of requests for it.

For parsing reStructuredText documents Rinohtype depends on docutils_. For
parsing PNG images rinohtype depends on PurePNG_. pip_ takes care of these
requirement when you install rinohtype. If you want to include images other
than PDF, PNG or JPEG, you also need to install Pillow_.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _PurePNG: http://purepng.readthedocs.org
.. _Pillow: http://python-pillow.github.io


Getting Started
---------------

Installation is trivial::

    pip install rinohtype


reStructuredText Renderer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get started with rinohtype is to render a reStructuredText
document (such as `demo.txt`_) using the ``rinoh`` command line tool::

   rinoh demo.txt

When the script finishes, you will find ``demo.pdf`` alongside the input file.

By default ``rinoh`` renders the input document using the article template. Run
``rinoh --help`` to see how you can tell ``rinoh`` which document template and
style sheet to use.

.. _demo.txt: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/demo.txt


Sphinx Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rinohtype can be used as a drop-in replacement for the LaTeX builder (the
``latex_documents`` configuration variable has to be set). You only need to add
``'rinoh.frontend.sphinx'`` to the ``extensions`` list in ``conf.py``. With
this in place, you can select the `rinoh` builder when building the
documentation::

    sphinx-build -b rinoh . _build/rinoh

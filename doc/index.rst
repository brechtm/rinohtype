RinohType: The Python Document Processor
========================================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Release History <changelog>`)

RinohType is the heavy-duty PDF library for Python. It helps automating the
creation of any type of document, ranging from invoices to long, complex
technical documents.

Additionally, RinohType offers a modern alternative to LaTeX_ when paired with
Sphinx_. Sphinx helps writing large documents and supports a multitude of
different output formats including searchable HTML. RinohType provides a Sphinx
backend that allows generating beautiful PDF documents.

Here is a list of RinohType's most important features:

* built on Unicode; ready for non-latin languages
* a powerful page layout system supporting columns, running headers/footers,
  floatable elements and footnotes
* figures, large tables and automatically generated table of contents
* automatic numbering and cross-referencing of headings, figures and tables
* use one of the included document templates or create your own
* an intuitive style sheet system inspired by CSS
* modular design allowing for multiple frontends (such as reStructuredText,
  Markdown, DocBook, ...) and backends (PDF, SVG, bitmap, ...)
* handles OpenType, TrueType and Type1 fonts with support for advanced
  typographic features such as kerning, ligatures and small capitals
* embeds PDF, PNG and JPEG images, preserving transparency and color profiles
* easy to deploy; pure-Python with few dependencies


RinohType is currently in a beta phase. We are working toward a first stable
release.

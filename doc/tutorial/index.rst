Tutorial
========

This tutorial is intended to provide a practical introduction to using
rinohtype.

It uses Sphinx to create a multi-page document, that rinohtype renders
as a PDF, complete with customised templates and styling.

Work through the tutorial step-by-step. Each step builds on the previous one,
and introduces you to a concept, tool or process in rinohtype.
